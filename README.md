Wind's Whisper
Summary:
This project is the official (non-commercial) website for the Wind’s Whisper (风言风语) game studio co-founded by Yuxin and Shuyue. It would consist of a fancy opening game, basic information about ourselves and our projects, and a form for comments or feedback. While we want it to display the general information that people would look for in an official website (our projects, contact info, etc.), we also want people to have a playful experience. We hope to exhibit some basic JS skills and aesthetics as game designers through this project.

Inspiration:
As game designers, we are interested in the delivery of socio-cultural and educational significance through playful environments. We hope our audience to explore personal meaning when having fun. The idea of the project comes from the name of our studio, Wind’s Whisper (referring to the sarcastic meaning of rumors and the whisper of the wind), which is a combination of the derivative imagery of both our names. As a result, we would present a leaf flowing everywhere in the blowing wind as the interactive event to engage the audience, echoing the theme of our website.

Google's Halloween opening

Process:
Technically, the steps needed to test our concept are as follows: (a) identifying the js logic in our website events, (b) searching keywords of the event effects on google to see how it is implemented with js, and (c) searching existing works to see what we can borrow from their codes.
For the upcoming weeks, we would like to use the class time to further develop our website with the following steps: (a) building up html framework for the web content & finalizing the information hierarchy, (b) finalizing the visual style of the website & creating css effects, (c) integrating js elements and events for the entire website, (d) reviewing the preliminary work and adding more animated effects and interactive components, and (e) media query on different devices.
